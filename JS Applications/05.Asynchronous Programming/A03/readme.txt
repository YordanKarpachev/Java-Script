Write a JS program that loads all commit messages and their authors from a github repository using a given HTML. 
The loadCommits() function should get the username and repository from the HTML textboxes with IDs "username" and "repo" and make a GET request to the Github API:
https://api.github.com/repos/<username>/<repository>/commits
Swap <username> and <repository> with the ones from the HTML:
    • In case of success, for each entry add a list item (<li>) in the unordered list (<ul>) with id "commits" with text in the following format:
"<commit.author.name>: <commit.message>" 
    • In case of an error, add a single list item (<li>) with text in the following format:
"Error: <error.status> (Not Found)"
